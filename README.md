Containerized Java Application with Oracle Database

Your team is working on a Java-based application that interacts with an Oracle
Database. You want to ensure that the application and the database can be easily set
up and tested in a containerized environment.

#### Task
Develop a Java application that connects to an Oracle Database. Containerize both the
Java application and the Oracle Database using Docker. Use GitLab for version control
and CI/CD pipelines. Create a pipeline that builds the Docker images for the Java
application and the Oracle Database, runs tests, and deploys the application with the
database as containers.

#### Follow-up Meeting
During the follow-up meeting, showcase your GitLab repository, discuss your
approach to containerizing the application and the database, and demonstrate how the
CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes. Be prepared to
explain your code, Docker setup, and any optimizations you made for the containerized
environment.
